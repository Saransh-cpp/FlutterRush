Flutter Rush Hackathon entry

This is not complete as I was preparing for my examinations but I tried my best to create something that worked with the API. I was going to design the app today but the repository access expired and then I gave up (thinking that the hackthon ended and I am late). Now it is too late to make any changes, hence, I decided that I will submit the code that I was working on.

The code requires a lot of refactoring at the moment and has almost no comments. The UI is not good but the code is functional.
